## Introduction

> Welcome to the guide about Rust Programming Language. Rust can be better identified as a system programming language that focuses mainly on rapidity, concurrency and security and upholding pure-function, imperative-procedural and object oreinted style. Rust intends to be higly reliable, concurrent, secure and overall extremely efficient.
This has led to the thorough development and progression on these fields and particularly on control on memory layout. 
Performance of Rust is oftentimes compared to that of C-like languages.

## History

> Rust is fairly a new language relative to its predecessors, e.g. C, which preceded it by 38 years. Rust is considered to be a breed of C-type language, but with advanced features which creates significant advantages over its ancestors.

First, Rust is heavily inspired by Cyclone (a safe dialect of C and a fundamental language), with some aspects of object-oriented features from C++. But, it also includes functional features from languages like Haskell and OCaml. The result is a C-like language that supports multiparadigm programming (imperative, functional, and object oriented). Rust is sponsored by Mozilla Research.

## Some interesting features:
> - It's the holy grail of memory management
> - Avoids garbage collecting, refcounting, and manual memory management
> - Immutable by default, no global variables, private by default, and so on...

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```

## About the tools

> _Describe the compiler or interpreter needed_.

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _Organize your report according to the project description
document_.
